## Heart-Disease-Prediction 

### Overview

A simple web application which uses Cosine Similiarity to give Book Recommendation to any reader by providing the name of the book.

### Motivation 

I am an avid reader and one day while I was reading my favorite novel 'Harry Potter' I was just thinking if there are any other novels related to this book. So being a Data and ML enthusiast I thought of developing a 'Book Recommendation System' which takes input from user and gives the result. 
 
 ### Technical Aspect
 
 This Project is mainly divided into two parts:
 
 1. Exploring the dataset and traning the model using `Sklearn`.
 2. Building a `flask` web app.


### Tech Stack Used: 
  * Python Version: 3.8
  
  * Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium, flask, json, pickle

### Future work 

- improve model performance.
